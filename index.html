                                Three couples, heterosexual and homosexual, show the unifying element of
                                love, the loss of balance in the dynamic of two, and the journey of the individual in relationship. Set to Cello Sonata in A minor by 
                                Edvard Grieg, this film interweaves dance and fiction to show mankind's intense desire for connection, the limitations of relationship, 
                                and how ultimately, we are all on a journey alone.

                                Even with the increased visibility of LGBTQ struggles and
                                individuals, many public spaces remain inherently unsafe for Queer People of Color (QPOC). For many people who experience 
                                oppression at the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality, recent gains in legal rights do little to ensure that they are safe in the

                                Cornelius, revives Samuel's memories. He was 20 years old when he discovered is attraction to Cornelius. Tormented by regret and 
                                misunderstood by all, he never revealed his homosexuality to Cornelius's family, whom he had invited that evening. After their

                                to his lost love.

                                For the last 20 years, Phatima
                                Rude has pioneered the performative alternative queer punk drag scene that has now become internationally famous, yet Phatima 
                                remains on the fringe of society, living out of a van. This gritty and intimate documentary follows Phatima's struggles and triumphs 
                                with illness, poverty, addiction, and gender identity.
